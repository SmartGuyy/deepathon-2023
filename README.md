# Deepathon 2023

Welcome to the Deepathon 2023!

The Deepathon is a virtual hackathon offering an exciting opportunity for innovative minds to come together, collaborate, and build something amazing with DeepSquare!

## About DeepSquare

DeepSquare is a cutting-edge decentralized High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform. It leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient computing ecosystem. DeepSquare aims to revolutionize the way computational tasks are executed by providing a decentralized infrastructure for High-Performance Computing.

## The Objective

The main aim of this Deepathon is to learn and use the DeepSquare platform and explore its capabilities, while fostering your innovation and demonstrating your skills in the rich world of HPC.

This Deepathon is not only a way to test DeepSquare, but also to try out DeepSquare's democratized HPC and simplified workflows, all in the festive atmosphere of Christmas.

## How to participate

Registration are open until the end of the Deepathon: Sunday 17th 12:00 pm CET (Sunday 17th 03:00 am PST).

You can register by filling [this form](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1uK-vralnR0aQZZO4UmA0lwev6gi).

## Submitting your project(s)

To submit your project to the Deepathon, you must:

- 1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the this Git repository.
  2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it on your computer.
  3. Create a directory inside `/submissions` named after your project.
  4. Create a `/submissions/<project>/README.md`.
  5. [Create a Pull-Request (PR).](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

  If you have any issues, you can send a message on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NCu7a6Tb5W).

- The PR and README must describe:

  - Your project.
  - Your team name.
  - How to use.
  - The chosen theme and missions (1 theme, multiple missions).

- Your project must contain a working workflow file in YAML, or a reference to the source code generating a workflow file.

- If the project is web-based, add a reference to the URL of the website. The website must be hosted until the end of the weekend.

- The project should be completed within the Deepathon's timeframe.

- The project should be functional to the extent that judges can review and assess it. A mere concept or idea without any working prototype is not sufficient.

- The solution should be original and innovative, offering a new approach or idea.

## Finding teams and collaborating

You can find teams on the `#dev` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NCu7a6Tb5W). Tech support are also there. Organizers can be contacted on [Telegram](https://t.me/DeepSquareProject). You can see the relevant links on or [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/deepsquare).

Feel free to discuss, stream, share your projects on social networks, video hosting platform and GitHub! It's all about learning, discover and innovate in the decentralized HPC ecosystem!
